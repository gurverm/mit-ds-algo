# Lecture 1: Algorithms and Computation

Goals:

1.  Solve computational problems
2.  Prove correctness
3.  Argue efficiency
4.  Communication of these ideas

## Problem

What is a computational problem? 
* inputs 
* outputs

## Algorithm

What is an algorithm? 
* A method for solving a problem. In other words it is a function that maps each input to a siongle output.

For birthday problem:
* maintain record 
* interview students in some order 
  * check if birthday is in record
  * if so return pair 
  * else add new student to record
* return no pair
